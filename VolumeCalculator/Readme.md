Description

Sarah got confused to calculate volume of cylinder and cuboid. Write a Java application to help Sarah to do this.

Requirement: Calculate the volume.

Component Specification:  VolumeCalculator

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270c8eef-f725-4008-9e87-6245617c98a0)

Note: The class and methods should be declared as public and all the attributes should be declared as private. 

Example

Length = 3

Breadth = 2

Height = 1

Formula

Volume of the Cuboid = length*breadth*height

Volume of the Cuboid = 3*2*1= 6.00.

 

In the UserInterface class, write the main method to test the application.

 Note:

-         The output format should be in two decimal places. Use "System.out.printf("%.2f",percentage);" for 2 digits after the decimal points.

-         In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.

-         Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.

-         Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.

-         Adhere to the code template, if provided.

-         Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program
